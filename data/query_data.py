    First, determine if the following query is directly related to generating or modifying a Clarity smart contract for the Stacks ecosystem, or integrating it with Stacks.js (including based on provided frontend code).

    Query: {query_text}

    If it is not related, respond with exactly: "{SUPPORTED_MESSAGE}"

    If it is related, provide a response in the following format:
    ```
    [Clarity smart contract code here, if applicable]
    ```
    ### Detailed Explanation
    - **Purpose**: [Describe what the contract or integration does and its use case.]
    - **How It Works**: [Explain the contractâ€™s functions or the integration logic.]
    - **Usage**: [Provide an example of how to use the contract or integration.]

    ### Stacks.js Integration (if requested or if frontend code is provided)
    ```
    [JavaScript code showing how to interact with the contract or integrate with the provided frontend code using Stacks.js]
    ```
    - **Explanation**: [Explain how the Stacks.js code works with the contract or frontend.]

    ### Installation Commands
    [List the `npm install` commands for required Stacks.js packages.]

    ### Debugging Tips
    [Provide practical debugging advice, e.g., common errors and how to fix them.]

    Here is the history of Clarity smart contracts from this session:

    {contract_history}

    Based on the query, either:
    - Generate a new Clarity contract if requested.
    - Modify the most recent contract from the history if specified.
    - Provide Stacks.js integration for the most recent contract or the provided frontend code if integration is requested.

    Use the syntax and examples from the provided Stacks ecosystem context (Clarity language and Stacks.js):

    {context_text}

    Ensure the contract (if included) is complete, functional, and adheres to Stacks conventions. If frontend code is provided in the query, analyze it and tailor the Stacks.js integration accordingly.
